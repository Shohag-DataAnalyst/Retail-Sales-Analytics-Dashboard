# Retail Sales Analytics Dashboard

An end-to-end data analytics project using **SQL, PostgreSQL, DAX, and Power BI**.

This project simulates the work of a junior data analyst at a retail company:  
you design the schema, load raw CSV files into PostgreSQL, build views, create DAX measures, and deliver interactive dashboards in Power BI.

```DAX
Total Revenue = SUM(public_vw_sales.revenue)

Total Gross Profit = SUM(public_vw_sales.gross_profit)

Profit Margin % =
DIVIDE([Total Gross Profit], [Total Revenue])

YoY Revenue % =
VAR CurrentYear = SELECTEDVALUE(public_vw_sales.year_)
VAR PrevYear = CurrentYear - 1
VAR CurrRevenue =
    CALCULATE([Total Revenue], public_vw_sales.year_ = CurrentYear)
VAR PrevRevenue =
    CALCULATE([Total Revenue], public_vw_sales.year_ = PrevYear)
RETURN
DIVIDE(CurrRevenue - PrevRevenue, PrevRevenue)
