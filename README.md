# Retail Sales Analytics Dashboard

An end-to-end data analytics project using **SQL, PostgreSQL, DAX, and Power BI**.

This project simulates the work of a junior data analyst at a retail company:  
you design the schema, load raw CSV files into PostgreSQL, build views, create DAX measures, and deliver interactive dashboards in Power BI.

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes retail sales performance across multiple years.  
The goal was to build a complete, end-to-end analytics workflow including:

- SQL-based data cleaning & transformation  
- Data modeling in PostgreSQL  
- Calculation of key KPIs using DAX  
- Interactive Power BI dashboards for insights & decision-making  

---

## 📌 Business Questions Answered

This project was designed to answer key business questions for a retail company.

### **1. Sales Performance**
- What is the total revenue for each year?
- Which categories contribute the most to sales?
- What are the sales trends over time (monthly, quarterly, yearly)?
- Which products generate the highest revenue and profit?

### **2. Customer Insights**
- How do different customer segments (gender, income, etc.) contribute to revenue?
- Which customer groups purchase the highest-margin products?

### **3. Product Performance**
- Which products have the highest gross profit?
- What are the top-performing products by revenue?
- Which categories and subcategories consistently perform well?

### **4. Returns Analysis**
- What is the return rate (%) by product category?
- Which products have high return rates and low profitability?
- Are certain territories linked to higher return volume?

### **5. Time Intelligence Analysis**
- How does monthly revenue change over time?
- What is the 3-month moving average trend?
- What is the year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth?

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies  
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)** – for data cleaning, joining, calculations  
- **Power BI** – for data modeling, DAX measures, visualization  
- **DAX** – custom KPI calculations  
- **GitHub** – version control & project documentation

## 🧱 Dataset & Data Model

The project is built on a simple retail star schema:

### **Fact Tables**
- **fact_sales** – one row per order line (date, customer, product, territory, quantity)
- **returns_data** – product returns by date, territory, and product

### **Dimension Tables**
- **calendar** – full date table (year, quarter, month, weekdays, etc.)
- **dim_customer** – customer demographics and income
- **dim_product** – product details (SKU, name, price, cost, attributes)
- **dim_product_subcategories** – product subcategories
- **dim_product_categories** – product categories
- **dim_territory** – region, country, continent

### **Table Relationships**
- fact_sales.order_date → calendar.calendar_date  
- fact_sales.customer_key → dim_customer.customer_key  
- fact_sales.product_key → dim_product.product_key  
- fact_sales.territory_key → dim_territory.territory_key  
- dim_product.product_subcategory_key → dim_product_subcategories.product_subcategory_key  
- dim_product_subcategories.product_category_key → dim_product_categories.product_category_key  
- returns_data.product_key → dim_product.product_key  
- returns_data.territory_key → dim_territory.territory_key  
- returns_data.return_date → calendar.calendar_date

## 🧮 Key DAX Measures  
```DAX
Total Revenue = SUM(public_vw_sales.revenue)

Total Gross Profit = SUM(public_vw_sales.gross_profit)

Profit Margin % =
DIVIDE([Total Gross Profit], [Total Revenue])

YoY Revenue % =
VAR CurrentYear = SELECTEDVALUE(public_vw_sales.year_)
VAR PrevYear = CurrentYear - 1
VAR CurrRevenue =
    CALCULATE([Total Revenue], public_vw_sales.year_ = CurrentYear)
VAR PrevRevenue =
    CALCULATE([Total Revenue], public_vw_sales.year_ = PrevYear)
RETURN
DIVIDE(CurrRevenue - PrevRevenue, PrevRevenue)

```
